# NetflixMovieRatingPredictionSystem


Project Idea

The project idea involves predicting ratings users will give to a set of movies based on the ones they
have rated previously as well as the ratings given by similar users to similar movies. We will also be
discovering clusters consisting of similar movies and similar users. Based on the model we will train
using the given data, we would be predicting which movies a user could have rated in a particular
year (2006 here).

Due to the large size of the training dataset, we are trying to explore different possibilities to handle it
by using a big data platform like Apache Spark which can manage large datasets in a better way than
a typical python package like pandas can. We aim to calculate the accuracy of our model and try to
improve it to the best we can by using a suitable algorithm.
